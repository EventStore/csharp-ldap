/*  The DynamicGroup.cs sample demonstrates how to:
 *  1) create the Dynamic Group Entry cn=myDynamicGroup
 *     in a specified container with a specified memberQueryURL
 *  2) read and print the values of the "member" attribute of cn=myDynamicGroup
 *  3) delete the dynamic group
 *
 *  Notes on Dynamic Groups:
 *
 *  Dynamic groups are supported in Novell eDirectory version 8.6.1 or later.
 *
 *  A dynamic group is similar to a group entry, but has a search URL
 *  attribute.  Entries satisfying the search URL are considered members of
 *  the group. The DN of each member will be returned when reading the
 *  "member" (or its synonym "uniqueMember") attribute.
 *
 *  A dynamic group is created either with objectClass="dynamicGroup" or by
 *  adding the auxiliary class "dynamicGroupAux" to an existing group entry.
 *
 *  The search URL is specified in the "memberQueryURL" attribute.
 *  The value of "memberQueryURL" is encoded as an "Ldap URL".
 *
 *  An entry may be statically added to a dynamic group by adding its DN
 *  to the "member" (or its synonym "uniqueMember") attribute.  Similarly
 *  an entry may be statically excluded from the group by adding its DN to the
 *  "excludedMember" attribute. These entries will be included or excluded
 *  from the group regardless of the search URL.
 *
 *  Note: at the present time, the only way to view only the static members
 *  of a dynamic group is to delete the memberQueryURL attribute and
 *  then read the member attribute.
 *
 *  In order to provide consistent results when processing the search URL,
 *  the authorization identity DN used to determine group membership is based
 *  on the following criteria:
 *  1) If the "dgIdentity" attribute is present, its value is the identity DN.
 *  2) If the above is false, and if the dynamic group entry contains a
 *     public/private key, then the DN of the group entry is the identity DN.
 *  3) If neither of the above are true, then the anonymous identity is the
 *     identity DN.
 *
 *  The creator of the group cannot set the "dgIdentity" attribute to a DN
 *  to which he or she does not already have rights.  The dynamic group entry
 *  and the DN specified by dgIdentity must be on the same server.
 *
 *  The "dgAllowDuplicates" attribute enables or disables the presence
 *  of duplicate values in the "membership" attribute. The default is false.
 *  Setting this attribute to true results in a faster search, but some values
 *  in the "membership" attribute may be duplicates.
 *
 *  The "dgTimeout" attribute determines the number of seconds to wait to get
 *  results from another server during dynamic group member search, when the
 *  search spans multiple servers.
 *
 *  The format the search URL in the memberQueryUrl attribute is:
 *      Ldap:///<base dn>??<scope>?<filter>[?[!]x-chain]
 *
 *  The optional extension "x-chain" causes the server to chain to other
 *  servers if necessary to complete the search. When present, the search
 *  will NOT be limited to the host server.  This extension should be used
 *  carefully. The exclamation indicates it is a critical extension, and if set
 *  the server will return an error if chaining is not supported or enabled.
 *
 *  For example, to create a dynamic group consisting of all entries in the
 *  "ou=sales,o=acme" subtree with the title "Manager", set memberQueryURL to:
 *      "Ldap:///ou=sales,o=acme??sub?(title=Manager)"
